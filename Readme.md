[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kompetenzbolzen/engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kompetenzbolzen/engine)

## Compiling

engine should compile just fine with just the c++ standard librarys.
Required Packages:

    g++
    make

this creates two folders in ./build/: lib and inc, wich hold the library and the headers respectively. these can then be copied into your projects directory.

## Using

Compile your program with linkerflags:

    -L/path/to/lib -lengine -lstdc++
