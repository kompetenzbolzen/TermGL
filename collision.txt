collision check by using object map from click registering
collision passed as returns
cObject::collision? for both objects?

bool onCollisionActive(unsigned int _hit, onCollisionPassice(_hit))
_hit: TOP,BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT
return true: abort move ; false: continue move

int onCollisionPassive(unsigned int _hit)
_hit: TOP,BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT
return: Maybe object type to tell object what it hit
